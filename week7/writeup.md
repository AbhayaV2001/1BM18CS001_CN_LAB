<h1>Configure RIP routing protocol in routers:</h1>

<h3>Procedure:</h3>
<ol>
<li>A topology was created using three routers namely router0, router1 and router2 and two PCs PC0 and PC1 connected as shown in the figure.
<li>Router interfaces were configured using the command: ip address address subnet_mask.
<li>Encapsulation ppp and clock rates were specified as required.
<li>RIP routing protocol was configured using the command: 'router rip'.
</ol>
<h3>Observations:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The command show ip route shows the ip routes configured.
<li>Pinging PC1 from PC0 gives the required output.
</ol>
<h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Creating a topology with three routers connected via serial DCE connections and 2 PCs.
<li>Configuring router interfaces using encapsulation ppp and clock rate as required
<li>Configuring RIP routing protocol in routers.
<li>Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a dynamic routing protocol which uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network.
<li>On proper configuration of rip routing protocol in routers, pinging gives the required response.</ol>
